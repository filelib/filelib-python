# Getting Started
Filelib.com is a platform that provides truly resumable file uploads over its REST API.

We have created an SDK that will help you get started with your integration.

## Installation


FilelibPy is published as a [Python package] and can be installed with
`pip`, follow the instructions below:

[Python package]: https://pypi.org/project/filelibpy/

!!! note "Installing with PIP" 
    
    === "PIP"
    
        ``` sh
        pip install filelibpy
        ```
    
    === "Development"
    
        ``` sh
        pip install git+https://github.com/filelib/filelib-python.git#egg=filelibpy
        ```
    
        1.  Although this will install the Filelib Python package with the latest changes,
            it is not a stable version and may have breaking changes.



This will install the package with all its dependencies.
