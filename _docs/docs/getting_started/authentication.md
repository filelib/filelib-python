# Authentication Credentials

Filelib API requires all incoming requests to be authenticated.

Filelib API uses [JWT] to authenticate a consumer(you as a client) and our Python SDK 
provides functionality to help you authenticate your requests.

To do that, SDK requires Authentication Credentials.

[JWT]: https:jwt.io

# How to acquire Authentication Credentials


After you create an account on Filelib.com, go over to https://filelib.com/dashboard/credentials

There you can generate your first set of credentials that you can use within SDK.
