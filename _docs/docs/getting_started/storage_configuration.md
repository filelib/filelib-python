### Storage Configuration

Storage configuration is where you tell Filelib API to place your uploaded files to.

Filelib does not store any of the files that or parts that are being uploaded on its own server/storage.

Each upload goes directly to your own bucket/container.

To do that, Filelib must have access to your storage buckets/containers. 

You can give access to Filelib in your dashboard at https://filelib.com/dashboard/storage
